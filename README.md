# Code-Foxtrot

* This project first started to create a full stack web application using MERN stack (React, Node.js, and MongoDB).
* Now I use it for experimenting any kind of network ideas.
  
## Backend

* Host the backend on local network x (defined in code) port by running start script.
* Forward the free ngrok url to the local network x port to make it globally accessible.

## Frontend

* Deploy the frontend to the github pages url (https://omerfuyar.github.io/Code-Foxtrot) by running deploy script.
* Frontend makes api calls to the ngrok url which is globally accessible.

## Finally
* Finally we have a globally accessible backend running in our own machine.
* I used to use Render servers to do this, but now I decided to go that way. It is still configurable in the code.
* Types in the src/common directories must be the same all the time.
